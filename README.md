# 04-2D-Platformer
Project for MSCH-C220, 14 October 2021

A 2D platformer project featuring basic mechanics.

## Implementation
Built using Godot 3.3.3

The player sprite is an adaptation of [MV Platformer Male](https://opengameart.org/content/mv-platformer-male-32x64) by MoikMellah. CC0 Licensed.

The coin sprite is provided by Kenney.nl: [https://kenney.nl/assets/puzzle-pack-2](https://kenney.nl/assets/puzzle-pack-2).

The explosion animation is also adapted from Kenney.nl: [https://kenney.nl/assets/tanks](https://kenney.nl/assets/tanks).

Parallax backgrounds are provided by: [opengameart.org](https://opengameart.org/content/2d-backgrounds-for-platformer-game-dungeons-and-cave-parallax-vector-illustration).

Main Menu Music: [Kid Chameleon Main Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2coFyd0eys&list=PL1D13F6A96FE76117)

The terrain spritemap is from the [Abstract Platformer package](https://kenney.nl/assets/abstract-platformer) available at Kenney.nl.

The bat sprite was originally created by bagzie for Stendhal and was [reworked by AntumDeluge](https://opengameart.org/content/bat-rework). 

The pathfinding code was adapted from the good work done by FEDEOD: [https://github.com/FEDE0D/godot-pathfinding2d-demo](https://github.com/FEDE0D/godot-pathfinding2d-demo). Special thanks goes to GDQuest for their excellent pathfinding tutorial: [https://www.gdquest.com/tutorial/godot/2d/navigation2d-tilemap-pathfinding/](https://www.gdquest.com/tutorial/godot/2d/navigation2d-tilemap-pathfinding/).

Level Music: [Kid Chameleon Cave Music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhX-do_erUA&list=PL1D13F6A96FE76117&index=2)

Hurt Sound: [opengameart.org](https://opengameart.org/content/hurt-death-sound-effect-for-character)

Coin Sound: [opengameart.org](https://opengameart.org/content/correct-bell)
